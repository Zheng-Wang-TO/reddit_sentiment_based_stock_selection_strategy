Historical Reddit Scraper for Weekly Top 5 S&P 500 Tickers (2021-2023)

This script scrapes popular financial subreddits to find the top 5 most
mentioned S&P 500 tickers each week. It dynamically filters tickers to ensure
they were part of the S&P 500 during the specific week of mention.

This version has been refactored for clarity and maintainability.
